    old "Hi [player]!\n\nI see you're making Monika really happy and I want to help any way I can!\nI added a new deck of cards that you can give to Monika. I'm sure you two can figure out how to play the game.\n\nTo give it to her, create a new file 'noudeck.gift' in the 'characters' folder.\n\nKeep up being a good [boy] and good luck with Monika!\n\nP.S: Don't tell her about me!"
